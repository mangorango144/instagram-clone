## 🧪 Learning by Doing — The Good *and* the Bad

In this project, I intentionally explored a wide range of coding practices — both good and bad — like prop drilling, code repetition, and inconsistent state management. The goal was to **get hands-on experience** and develop a deeper understanding of *why* some approaches scale better and others cause problems in real-world apps.

This helped me see the value in patterns like component abstraction, global state management with Redux, and clean file structure.

## 👨‍💻 Motivation

I'm building this to sharpen my frontend skills and showcase modern tech like React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind in a real-world app.
